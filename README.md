# CaesarCipherAndroidKotlin

This is a simple Android Kotlin App for the Caesar Cipher.
As 100% efficiency can not be attained with anything, I would gladly accept comments and suggestions on how to improve the code.
Also, I am not a front-end Dev so the design is a bit raw like the first three letters of my name :)
Thanks
